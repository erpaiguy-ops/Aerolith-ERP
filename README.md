# Aerolith-ERP

A modular ERP for joinery and fit-out contracting — factory production, site works,
and the commercial layer that joins them. Each module is sellable standalone; all
of them together are one ERP.

Target markets: UAE, Qatar and the wider Middle East. Country specifics are **data,
not code** — see [`docs/06-localisation.md`](docs/06-localisation.md).

## Status

Kernel scaffold. The platform layer every module will depend on is in place and
tested; no business modules yet.

**Built and working**

- Monorepo (pnpm + Turborepo), TypeScript strict, ESLint, **enforced module boundaries**
- Full kernel Postgres schema — tenancy, identity, RBAC, audit, numbering,
  documents, approvals, notifications, custom fields, master data, outbox, localisation
- **Row Level Security** on all 44 tenant-scoped tables, with append-only enforcement
  on the audit trail
- Module manifest + registry with per-tenant entitlement resolution
- Typed event bus over a transactional outbox
- Data-driven localisation with country packs for **AE, QA, SA, OM, BH, KW**
- 83 tests, including integration tests that prove tenant isolation holds

**Not built yet** — module APIs, the web app, and every business module.
See [`docs/05-roadmap.md`](docs/05-roadmap.md).

## Getting started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm db:up          # Postgres 17 in Docker
pnpm db:migrate     # schema + RLS policies + app role
pnpm db:seed        # rule catalogue + country packs

pnpm verify         # typecheck, lint, boundary check, tests
```

Integration tests need a database:

```bash
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://aerolith:aerolith@localhost:5432/aerolith pnpm test
```

## Layout

```
packages/
  kernel/              the platform — everything depends on it, it depends on nothing
    src/db/schema/     the kernel Postgres schema
    src/db/rls.ts      tenant isolation policies
    src/modules/       manifest + registry (how standalone vs unified works)
    src/events/        typed event bus over the outbox
    src/localisation/  country-as-data: packs, rule resolution, adoption
    packs/             AE, QA, SA, OM, BH, KW — adding a country is a JSON file

## Headline decisions

- **TypeScript everywhere** — Next.js + NestJS + Drizzle + Postgres, one Turborepo.
- **Modular monolith** with mechanically enforced boundaries — not microservices,
  not a big ball of mud.
- **Standalone vs unified is a licensing concern**, not a deployment one: same
  binary, per-tenant module entitlements.
- **Documents, approvals and reporting are kernel capabilities**, built once and
  used by every module.
- **Country specifics are data** — three-layer rule resolution (tenant → country →
  default), with tenants editing their own copy of everything.
- **Self-hosted on free-tier infrastructure**, designed to move to paid hosting the
  day there is a paying customer.

> The statutory values in the country packs (leave, gratuity, VAT rates,
> accommodation standards) are seeded starting points and must be verified against
> current law before running payroll or issuing tax invoices in production.
